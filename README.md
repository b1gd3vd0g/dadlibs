## Overview

**Dad Libs** is a web application allowing for the sharing of user-created mad-lib templates which they can play at home. **Dad libs** can contain suggestive themes, thus is geared more toward players 18+ (hence the name).

## Motivation

My motivation for this project is mainly to showcase my knowledge of full-stack web development, and to create something simple and fun. I do not expect many users, nor any amount of money for this project - I just hope that somebody has fun with it :)

## Tech stack

**Languages**

- JavaScript

**Libraries/Frameworks**

- React
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB

**Dad Libs** is a full-stack web application with a microservices architecture.

The frontend is written in react, using JavaScript and functional components.

The backend is split into several different microservices - some of these microservices utilize different technologies.

The **template-microservice** is written in JavaScript, and runs an express app on a node server utilizing a MongoDB database.

Although no more is written at the moment, I plan to change it up slightly for the **account microservice** and use tech I'm less familiar with - maybe python and postgres, or even rust.

## How to use

As of right now, this application is not usable in the slightest.

Check back later - I expect to finish the app entirely before the end of October.
